## Introduction

Free random projection leverages concepts from free probability and random matrices to enhance reinforcement learning algorithms. This approach allows for better exploration of state spaces and improved learning efficiency. The code in this repository aims to provide a clear implementation of these ideas, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to experiment with and apply these techniques.

## Topics Covered

This repository focuses on several key areas:

- **Free Probability**: Understanding the behavior of large random matrices and their applications in machine learning.
- **In-Context Reinforcement Learning**: Techniques that allow agents to adapt to new tasks based on prior experiences.
- **JAX**: A high-performance library for numerical computing, enabling automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.
- **Machine Learning**: General principles and practices that apply to various learning tasks.
- **Meta Reinforcement Learning**: Learning to learn, allowing agents to adapt quickly to new environments.
- **PopGym**: A toolkit for building and evaluating reinforcement learning environments.
- **Random Matrices**: Studying the properties of matrices with random entries and their implications.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training agents to make decisions based on rewards from their environment.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices to gain insights into their properties.
- **State-Space Models**: Modeling systems that evolve over time with hidden states.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the code effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Random Projection

This example demonstrates how to perform a basic random projection using the provided functions.

```python
from frp_rl import random_projection

data = ...  # Load your data here
projected_data = random_projection(data)
```

### Example 2: Reinforcement Learning Agent

This example shows how to create a reinforcement learning agent that utilizes free random projection.

```python
from frp_rl import RLAgent

agent = RLAgent()
agent.train()
```

### Example 3: Visualization

You can visualize the results of your random projections using matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume `results` contains your projection results
plt.scatter(results[:, 0], results[:, 1])
plt.title("Random Projection Results")
plt.show()
```
